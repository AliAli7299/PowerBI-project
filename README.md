This project consists of a PowerBI dashboard built using the contoso dataset, a virtual company designed by microsoft for analytics training.
You can find the link to the dashboard as well as the linkedin post discussing the work done in this dashboard in the Dashboard-Link category. In the SQL-Validation category, I have run some SQL code to verify the numbers calculated by PowerBI as a double verification.
